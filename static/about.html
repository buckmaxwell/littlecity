<h1>Hey Team</h1>

<p>I put this together this eveing because I wanted to see what a colloborative
	art project on the internet would look like.  You guys have thoughts,
	poems, garage sale ads, ascii art, and css and html skills. 
</p>
<p>
	Every time this page is updated, it is saved with a timestamp, so a week from now or so,
	I'll add a feature so we can traverse in time.
</p>

<p>
	For now though, let's live in the moment, and do some cool stuff. Add whatever
	you like, with the goal of making this a cool spot.  Invite your friends and 
	make it yours.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, nothing is built in to keep you from deleting the whole thing.  That's by 
	design.  If you don't wan't that to happen, don't do it.
</p>

<p>
	Finally -- this site was born today! (Sept. 2 2016).  It will have problems.
	bear with me, and we will get them all sorted out.
</p>

<p>
	Cheers, wormywormm
